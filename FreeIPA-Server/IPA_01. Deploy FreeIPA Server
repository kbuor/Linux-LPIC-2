                      This program will set up the IPA Server.

                      This includes:
                        * Configure a stand-alone CA (dogtag) for certificate management
                        * Configure the Network Time Daemon (ntpd)
                        * Create and configure an instance of Directory Server
                        * Create and configure a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
                        * Configure Apache (httpd)
                        * Configure DNS (bind)
                        * Configure the KDC to enable PKINIT

                      Enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer
                      on which you're setting up server software. Using the form
                      <hostname>.<domainname>
                      Example: master.example.com.

                      # confirm the hostname and Enter
                      Server host name [ipa.kbuor.local]: ENTER

                      Warning: skipping DNS resolution of host dlp.ipa.srv.world
                      The domain name has been determined based on the host name.

                      # confirm the domain name and Enter
                      Please confirm the domain name [kbuor.local]: ENTER

                      The kerberos protocol requires a Realm name to be defined.
                      This is typically the domain name converted to uppercase.

                      # confirm the realm name and Enter
                      Please provide a realm name [KBUOR.LOCAL]: ENTER
                      Certain directory server operations require an administrative user.
                      This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and has full access
                      to the Directory for system management tasks and will be added to the
                      instance of directory server created for IPA.
                      The password must be at least 8 characters long.

                      # set Directory Manager's password
                      Directory Manager password:
                      Password (confirm):

                      The IPA server requires an administrative user, named 'admin'.
                      This user is a regular system account used for IPA server administration.

                      # set IPA admin's password
                      IPA admin password:
                      Password (confirm):

                      The IPA Master Server will be configured with:

                      IP address(es): 10.0.14.101

                      The ipa-client-install command was successful

                      ==============================================================================
                      Setup complete

                      Next steps:
                              1. You must make sure these network ports are open:
                                      TCP Ports:
                                        * 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS
                                        * 389, 636: LDAP/LDAPS
                                        * 88, 464: kerberos
                                        * 53: bind
                                      UDP Ports:
                                        * 88, 464: kerberos
                                        * 53: bind
                                        * 123: ntp

                              2. You can now obtain a kerberos ticket using the command: 'kinit admin'
                                 This ticket will allow you to use the IPA tools (e.g., ipa user-add)
                                 and the web user interface.

                      Be sure to back up the CA certificates stored in /root/cacert.p12
                      These files are required to create replicas. The password for these
                      files is the Directory Manager password

kinit admin
klist
ipa config-mod --defaultshell=/bin/bash
